## Sample App Features
The **MailOrderCoffeeShop** app has 4 parts: 
* onboarding
* custom order
* menu
* order overview.

### Onboarding
The onboarding showcases the features of the app.
* There's an 'x' in the top left that dismisses the onboarding.
* You can swipe to view different onboarding screens.
* You can use the 'next arrow' in the bottom right to view the next onboarding screen.
* The 'next arrow' makes place for the 'done icon' on the last onboarding screen, which dismisses the onboarding.
* After being dismissed the onboarding will not be started again. Only after a clean install or after all app settings have been deleted.

### Custom Order
The custom order screen allows you to select different ingredients for your beverage.
* There are two buttons at the top, one for custom order and the other for the menu.
* The custom order button is disabled while on the custom order screen.
* The amount of espresso shots is controlled using the "+" and "-" buttons
* A counter shows the currently selected amount of shots
* If you try to select less than 0 shots (using the "-" button), a toast will be displayed.
* You can choose whether you'd like to have hot or cold espresso shots by using the "hot switch".
* The "hot switch" is set to true/on by default
* There's a spinner when you can select a type of milk to be added
* If the spinner is set to anything other than "no milk", you can select the milk preparation using radio buttons.
* If the milk type is set to custom % you get the ability to select a fat % using a seekbar (slider)
* The 'review order button' takes you to the 'order overview' screen
* Each order has to have at least 1 espresso shot: If you try to go to the order overview with 0 shots, a toast will be displayed.

### Menu
The menu screen allows you to pick a beverage from a scrollable list.
* There are two buttons at the top, one for custom order and the other for the menu.
* The menu button is disabled while on the menu screen.
*The list should be scrollable
* Each item on the list should have an icon, name and volume (in ml.)
* The icon should represent the beverage volume: 0-60ml == low, 61-180 == medium, 180+ == full.
* Clicking on an item should take you to the order overview screen.

### Order Overview
Allows you to review the order and submit the order using email
* Shows the beverage name for items from the menu
* The cup image should represent the beverage volume: 0-60ml == low, 61-180 == medium, 180+ == full
* The ingredients list should show all the ingredients, one for each line
* You can enter your name in the 'name edit text'
* You can enter your email address in the 'email edit text'
* If it's a custom order there's an additional field where you can give your order a name.
* The submit button launches an email app and supplies the details for you.
* Entering your name is mandatory, if it's a custom order the order name is also mandatory. If you press submit while these fields are empty, error messages are displayed below the text fields.
